*Curl Critic* is one of the many side projects that I have and probably will not finish.  The idea is to collect data from social media to develop a profile on its customers sentiments about the product. My target audience are women who have natural coily hair and are looking for hair products thar will better serve their hair type. I faced this problem as a happy naturalista in finding a product that wont strip my of moisture or break my beautiful curls. 

# Prerequisites 
- Ruby 
- Node
- NPM

# Getting Started
Since I have a love for Ruby but my paycheck is for Javascript I decided to build this project combining the two.  The client side of the application is built in React.js (yay!!) using the Facebook's lovely create-react-app utility and the server is built in Rails (Woohoo!).  To spin up the application do the following:
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

Hopefully it is as simple as it looks but if not you can send me a tweet.
